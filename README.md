## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Next

Open localhost:3000

## To keep in mind

You can hide or show components in your app with the hook `useGetDimension` and you can use our `breakpoints` sizes for media querys

If you want to add more screen device resolution, you can use the hook `useGetDimensions` and add another size :

```
we have `isMobile` and `isDesktop`
```

but if you need other, like `isTablet` just add it on the hook.
